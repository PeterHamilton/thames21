It is on the Tideway near Isleworth in the Borough of Hounslow, London, England, and is one of the longest aits. It lies offshore from Heron\'s Place, and is opposite the \"London Apprentice\" public house.
Isleworth Ait is covered by densely-packed trees, and provides a sanctuary for a variety of wildlife. It floods regularly, but is home to more than 57 species of bird life, including the tree-creeper, kingfisher and heron. Two rare species of air-breathing land gastropods also live on the island, the two-lipped door snail Balea biplicata and the German hairy snail Pseudotrichia rubiginosa, as well as several rare species of beetles. This variety of unusual wildlife makes the island one of the London Wildlife Trust\'s most remarkable reserves.
Isleworth Ait was once a centre for the production of osier - a willow which used to be harvested on the island to weave baskets to carry fruit and vegetables grown in Middlesex to the markets in London. There used to be five neighbouring islands, but these have all disappeared over the centuries, some being destroyed by passing boat traffic. The River Crane flows into the Thames to the south of Isleworth Ait.
Thames Water owns the island, which houses the outfall from the nearby Mogden sewage treatment works, returning treated water to the river Thames. The Metropolitan Water Board bought the island from the Duke of Northumberland in the 1930s. Hounslow Council has designated Isleworth Ait a Local Nature Reserve.', :hyperlink => '', :lng => -0.32011240139779773, :lat => 51.46870452775363},

GREEN FLAG AWARD from 2000 to 2005. This award is the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales and recognises the best green spaces in the country. The park gained Local Nature Reserve status in November 2000 and is recognised as being one of the best places in London for watching wildlife.

The park is now being developed as a water-focused nature reserve, with 180 acres of rolling meadows, woodlands and lakes. Over 300 plants and 140 bird species have been recorded in the park and It is known to be a staging point for birds on their migration journeys. In addition to the wildlife, the park offers a wide range of activities including, walking, picnics, a trim trail, orienteering and fishing.

The north side of the park has been developed to a high standard. You can see pictures from around the north side and the nature reserve by clicking on the links at the top of this page. You can also see some pictures from the south side.

The south side of the park is divided from the north side by a railway track. A footbridge across the track, and public access to the south side of the park has been promised many times but never materialised. The south side of the park is currently closed to the public,	but	 the Friends of Bedfont Lakes Country Park intend to work towards the goal of installing a bridge to link the two sides of the park and having the south side developed to the same high standard as the north side.

Bedfont Lakes Country Park was cited as the top tourist attraction in the borough of Hounslow in the \'Hounslow Matters\' magazine in January 2006 and has been designated a Borough Park.
